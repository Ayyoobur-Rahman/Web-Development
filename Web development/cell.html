    <div class="vegetap">
        <p>Vegeta surprises everyone when he reveals his newfound ability to turn Super Saiyan: like Goku, Vegeta's eyes turn green and his hair turn a golden yellow. However, confident after defeating Super Saiyan Goku, Android 19 believes that he can easily defeat Vegeta, claiming that he already knows all of his moves. However, Vegeta laughs at these claims, mocking the fact that Dr. Gero did not observe the battles that took place on Namek. </p>

    <div class="piccolop">
        <p>Bulma is hard at work trying to figure out Dr. Gero's prints. Meanwhile, Piccolo and Android 17 are fighting each other. After Android 17 gets serious it turns out that he and Piccolo are evenly matched. Cell senses the two fighting and starts making his way towards them stating that his power level is now higher than theirs. Krillin, and the others on a nearby island, receive a call from Bulma saying that she has completed the switch to shut down the Androids and starts bringing it over. Android 17 states that since his stamina will never drop, he will be the victor of the battle. However, Cell arrives at the scene of the battle leaving Piccolo shocked. Meanwhile, Goku and Gohan are still waiting for Vegeta and Future Trunks to come out of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.</p>

        <h2> Super Saiyan Goku VS Perfect Cell</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="cellp">
        <p>The episode starts with Goku stepping into the ring to face Cell. Goku and Cell both have a short standoff before they begin. The two smile at one another and do a little sparring. Meanwhile, Jimmy Firecracker turns to the camera and fearfully tells the viewing audiences about how everyone may be in danger because of Mr. Satan's loss in the Cell Games. Future Trunks mentions Goku's control as a Super Saiyan, and Vegeta looks over to Gohan, as he knows that Gohan is also a Super Saiyan Full Power and may have the same power as Goku. Goku and Perfect Cell exchange blows, looking huge to the other Z Fighters, but they are really tiny when it comes to the true power of the combatants.</p>
