    <h2> Gohan VS Frieza</h2>
</div>
<div class="gohanp">
    <p> Gohan enraged over Frieza impaling Krillin. Vegeta remarks that Krillin should never have bothered helping Dende. Frieza sarcastically says that he cannot control himself before hurling Krillin off his horn and into the water below. Gohan darts towards Krillin, but Frieza quickly gets in front of him. He says that it is no use, as Krillin will die soon. Gohan angrily yells at Frieza to move, then connects with a kick and an uppercut, both to the face. He then punches Frieza several times in the stomach before kicking him away. As the tyrant hurtles backwards, Gohan fires a Ki Blast which hits home, knocking Frieza into the ground.</p>

    <h2> Goku VS Frieza</h2>
</div>
<div class="friezap">
    <p>Frieza kills Krillin by making his whole body explode in the air. Seeing his best friend killed causes Goku to erupt with even more rage. In a display of gathering energy, the angry Goku pulls out his strongest emotions ever before reached. His hair turns spikier and golden, and his eyes turn dark green. He is now a Super Saiyan, a legendary class of Saiyan, with his power tremendously increased. He tells Gohan to take Piccolo and retrieve Bulma and take them to the ship that he traveled in and use it to head back to Earth and get as far from Namek as possible.</p>
